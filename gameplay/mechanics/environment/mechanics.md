# Environment mechanics and gameplay

How temperature feels in play and how the runtime resolves hazards.

## Player-facing loop

```mermaid

  end
```

## Temperature display (°C / °F)

Settings gear → **Fahrenheit (°F)** (under Auto jump). Checked shows °F on the
minimap environment bar and related HUD readouts. Unchecked keeps °C. Preference
persists in localStorage. Dev Mode **Toggle °C / °F** uses the same store.
Combat and climate math always run in Celsius.

## Comfort bands

No environmental HP damage inside the comfort window. Base bounds come from
`DEFINING_WORLD_PLAZA_TEMPERATURE_COMFORT_*`. Heat/cold tolerance on the entity
widens the band before DoT starts.

| Boundary                 | Base °C     | With default tolerance buff | Below / above effect               |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Comfort low              | **−10**     | **−25** (`cold-tolerance`)  | Cold DoT begins below this         |
| Comfort high             | **50**      | **65** (`heat-tolerance`)   | Heat DoT begins above this         |
| Frost movement threshold | **0**       | unchanged                   | Speed reduction begins at or below |
| Absolute zero            | **−273.15** | unchanged                   | Movement multiplier hits **0**     |

Between comfort low and **0°C**: no climate DoT, but **frost slow** still applies.

## Damage formulas

Let `comfortHigh` / `comfortLow` be the resolved band (base ± tolerance bonuses).
Let `excess = max(0, celsius − comfortHigh)` and `deficit = max(0, comfortLow − celsius)`.

| Kind | Flat HP/s       | Max-HP %/s          |
| ---- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Heat | `excess × 0.35` | `excess × 0.00005`  |
| Cold | `deficit × 0.3` | `deficit × 0.00004` |

Total HP/s = `flat + effectiveMaxHealth × percent`.

Example: standing on lava (**920°C**) with no tolerance → excess **870°C** → **304.5** flat HP/s plus **4.35%** max HP/s.

The engine picks heat vs cold by whichever combined rate is higher.

## Resistance and weakness

After raw DoT rates resolve, entity `temperatureResistance` scales them:

```
multiplier = (1 − resistance) × (1 + weakness)
```

| Field                               | Effect                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `heatResistance` / `coldResistance` | Cuts matching DoT (0..1)                   |
| `heatWeakness` / `coldWeakness`     | Amplifies matching DoT (0..1 → +0%..+100%) |
| `heatComfortBonusCelsius`           | Raises comfort high before heat DoT        |
| `coldComfortBonusCelsius`           | Lowers comfort low before cold DoT         |
| `isHeatImmune` / `isColdImmune`     | Multiplier **0** for that exposure         |

Instant buffs: `heat-resistance-buff` / `cold-resistance-buff` (+25% resist). Instant debuffs: `heat-weakness-debuff` / `cold-weakness-debuff` (+25% weakness). Toggle buffs: `heat-tolerance-buff` / `cold-tolerance-buff` (**+15°C** comfort each). See [buffs](../buffs/).

Cold-immune entities also skip frost slow.

| `celsius ≥ 0`       | **1**                                    |
| `celsius ≤ −273.15` | **0**                                    |
| Between             | Linear: `(celsius − (−273.15)) / 273.15` |

## Tile sampling pipeline

### Step 1: Ambient climate

`climate.temperature` (0..1) → `convertingWorldPlazaClimateNormalizedToCelsius`:

```
celsius = -25 + noise × (48 - (-25))   // -25°C to 48°C
```

### Step 2: Night cooling

If `isDaytime` is false: `ambient −= 8°C`.

### Step 3: Biome and water overrides

| Condition                                              | Override                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Firelands biome tile                                   | `ambient = max(ambient, 62°C)` |
| Surface water + cold climate (≤ **0.3** noise) + night | **−14°C**                      |

### Step 4: Local sources (merge max)

Merged with `mergingWorldPlazaEnvironmentalTemperatureLevels`:

- Lava tile: **920°C**
- Block `environmentalTemperature` levels on tile
- Painted area profiles
- Lit campfire cell on tile: **72°C** (via block/cell wiring)

### Step 5: Neighbor averaging

Ring **2** (5×5). Tiles that **host** assignable sources (lava, campfire, painted zones) keep their peak; neighbors blend toward the average.

### Step 6: Player smoothing

Player readout eases toward the sampled tile target at **3**/second so HUD and damage do not snap on tile borders.

## Local heat source reference

| Source            | °C          | Radius / notes                               |
| ----------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Lava tile         | **920**     | Single tile; neighbors warm via 5×5 average  |
| Campfire tile     | **72**      | Standing tile on lit `utility:campfire` cell |
| Ice block tile    | **−22**     | Standing tile on `utility:ice-block`         |
| Frozen water      | **−14**     | Climate-frozen surface water at night        |
| Firelands ambient | **62** min  | Floor on ambient, not a point source         |
| Climate range     | **−25..48** | Before night offset                          |

Campfire fuel tiers affect **light** and **burn duration**, not the **72°C** tile constant. See [fire](../fire/) and [cooking-campfire](../cooking-campfire/).

## Frozen water interaction

Surface water phase uses assignable sources in the neighbor ring (**2**), then climate:

1. **Thaw** — warmest assignable source ≥ **0°C** (campfire, lava, heat zone) keeps water liquid
2. **Freeze** — else coldest assignable source < **0°C** (ice block, cold zone) freezes water
3. **Climate** — else climate noise ≤ **0.3** keeps ice; warmer climate stays liquid

- Frozen: walkable, no flow animation; fishing blocked
- Place `utility:ice-block` beside warm water to freeze it
- Place campfire/lava beside ice to thaw it (heat wins if both in ring)
- Remove cold source: warm-climate water thaws; climate-frozen water stays ice

| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Comfort edges        | `COMFORT_LOW/HIGH_CELSIUS`                                |

| Climate range        | `CLIMATE_MIN/MAX_CELSIUS`                                 |

| Source temps         | `LAVA/CAMPFIRE/FROZEN_WATER_CELSIUS`                      |
| Neighbor ring        | `NEIGHBOR_AVERAGING_RING`                                 |
| Player smoothing     | `SMOOTHING_RATE_PER_SECOND`                               |

## Edge cases

- **Campfire edge standing**: Neighbor average may be below **0°C** while on the fire tile; frost uses **local** eased readout.
- **Heat + cold sources**: Merge takes the effective level from combined block/area/lava rules, then averaging softens neighbors.
- **Firelands at night**: Ambient floor **62°C** still applies; night −8°C cannot drop Firelands below **62°C** ambient base after clamp.
